# LADES Matlab Developments

Welcome to the repository containing Matlab developments from the LADES research group at the Programa de Engenharia Quimica (PEQ), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

## About LADES

[LADES (Laboratory of Software Development)](http://lades.peq.coppe.ufrj.br/) is a research group dedicated to providing adequate support to the development of computer programs for mathematical modeling, simulation, optimization, inferences and analyzers, regulatory control, and advanced process control. Our efforts are focused around three fundamental axes:

1. The development of mathematical models and the numerical and analytical interpretation of the equations.
2. The development and implementation of process control and optimization schemes.
3. Experimental validation of mathematical models and control and optimization strategies.

## Contents

In this folder, you will find Matlab codes related to:

- Control Theory
- Process Modeling
- Optimization Techniques

These materials are the result of extensive research and collaboration within the LADES and PEQ community. They are intended for citation and use by the scientific community, future LADES researchers, and PEQ students.

## Research Papers

The codes and methodologies available in this repository have contributed to several research papers. We encourage researchers and practitioners to refer to these publications for detailed insights and proper citation.


## Contact and Collaboration
